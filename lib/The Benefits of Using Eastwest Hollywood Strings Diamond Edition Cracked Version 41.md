One of the main features of EastWest Hollywood Strings Diamond Edition is the Play engine, which allows you to load and play the samples with ease and flexibility. You can adjust the volume, pan, reverb, and EQ of each microphone position, as well as switch between different articulations using keyswitches or MIDI controllers. You can also use the built-in mixer to create custom mixes and save them as presets. The Play engine also supports 64-bit systems and multiple outputs for better performance and compatibility.
 
Another feature of EastWest Hollywood Strings Diamond Edition is the Hollywood Strings program, which is a standalone application that lets you access and edit the samples in more detail. You can change the tuning, vibrato, release trails, legato speed, and other parameters of each instrument and articulation. You can also use the Auto Divisi function to automatically split the sections into smaller groups according to your MIDI input. This way, you can achieve a more natural and realistic sound without having to load multiple patches.
 
EastWest Hollywood Strings Diamond Edition is not a cheap product, but it is definitely worth the investment if you are serious about orchestral music production. The sound quality, variety, and realism of the samples are unparalleled, and the Play engine and Hollywood Strings program offer a lot of control and customization options. Whether you are composing for film, TV, games, or music, EastWest Hollywood Strings Diamond Edition will provide you with a rich and inspiring sonic palette.
  
One of the challenges of using orchestral strings libraries is to make them sound realistic and expressive. EastWest Hollywood Strings Diamond Edition offers several tools and features to help you achieve that goal. For example, you can use the Round Robin function to cycle through different samples of the same note, avoiding the machine-gun effect that occurs when repeating the same sample. You can also use the Repetition function to play repeated notes with different bow strokes, creating a more natural and dynamic sound.
 
Another challenge of using orchestral strings libraries is to create realistic transitions and legato between notes. EastWest Hollywood Strings Diamond Edition uses a sophisticated legato engine that analyzes your MIDI input and applies the appropriate legato samples and settings. You can choose between different types of legato, such as slur, portamento, and fingered, and adjust the speed and volume of the transitions. You can also use the Legato Interval function to play intervals up to an octave with smooth and realistic legato.
 
A final challenge of using orchestral strings libraries is to create realistic and varied articulations and expressions. EastWest Hollywood Strings Diamond Edition offers a wide range of articulations and techniques that you can use to create different moods and styles. You can use short articulations such as spiccato, staccatissimo, and col legno for fast and rhythmic passages. You can use long articulations such as sustains, trills, and harmonics for slow and melodic passages. You can also use special articulations such as flautando, sul ponticello, and sul tasto for atmospheric and ethereal effects.
